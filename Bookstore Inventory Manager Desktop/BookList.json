On an average day, somewhere between 500,000 and 2 million coders do something in PHP. Even when you use a well-understood language like PHP, building a modern web application requires tools that decrease development time and cost while improving code quality. Frameworks such as Ruby-on-Rails and Django have been getting a lot of attention as a result.     For PHP coders, the Zend Framework offers that same promise without the need to move away from PHP. This powerful collection of components can be used in part or as a whole to speed up the development process. Zend Framework has the backing of Zend Technologies; the driving force behind the PHP programming language in which it is written. The first production release of the Zend Framework became available in July of 2007.

Writing a great framework requires an extraordinary set of skills-ranging from deep knowledge of a programming language and target platform to a crystal-clear view of the problem space where the applications to be developed using the framework will be used.    OSGi Application Frameworks shows a Java developer how to build frameworks based on the OSGi service platform. OSGi, an emerging Java-based technology for developing modular applications, is a great tool for framework building. A framework itself, OSGi allows the developer to create a more intuitive, modular framework by isolating many of the key challenges the framework developer faces.    This book begins by describing the process, principles, and tools you must master to build a custom application framework. It introduces the fundamental concepts of OSGi, and then shows you how to put OSGi to work building various types of frameworks that solve specific development problems.    OSGi is particularly useful for building frameworks that can be easily extended by developers to create domain-specific applications. This book teaches the developer to break down a problem domain into its abstractions and then use OSGi to create a modular framework solution. Along the way, the developer learns software engineering practices intrinsic to framework building that result in systems with better software qualities, such as flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.    Author Alexandre Alves guides you through major concepts, such as the definition of programming models and modularization techniques, and complements them with samples that have real applicability using industry-proved technologies, such as Spring-DM and Equinox.","Quantity":5,"QuantitySold":78,"Cost":27,"Price":472,"Benefit":445,"BenefitSold":34710},{"Title":"Flexible Rails","Isbn":"1933988509","PageCount":592,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/armstrong.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["Peter Armstrong"],"Categories":["Web Development"],"ShortDescription":"\u0022Flexible Rails created a standard to which I hold other technical books.

Simply put, Flex is the most productive way to build the UI of rich Internet applications, and Rails is the most productive way to rapidly build a database-backed CRUD application. Together, they\u0027re an amazing combination.    Flexible Rails is a book about how to use Ruby on Rails and Adobe Flex to build next-generation rich Internet applications (RIAs). The book takes you to the leading edge of RIA development, presenting examples in Flex 3 and Rails 2.    This book is not an exhaustive Ruby on Rails tutorial, nor a Flex reference manual. (Adobe ships over 3000 pages of PDF reference documentation with Flex.) Instead, it\u0027s an extensive tutorial, developed iteratively, how to build an RIA using Flex and Rails together. You learn both the specific techniques you need to use Flex and Rails together as well as the development practices that make the combination especially powerful.    The example application built in the book is MIT-licensed, so readers can use it as the basis for their own applications. In fact, one reader has already built an agile project management tool based on the book example!    With this book, you learn Flex by osmosis. You can read the book and follow along even if you have never used Flex before. Consider it \u0022Flex Immersion.\u0022 You absorb the key concepts of Flex as you go through the process of building the application.    You will also learn how Flex and Rails integrate with HTTPService and XML, and see how RESTful Rails controller design gracefully supports using the same controller actions for Flex and HTML clients. The author will show you how Cairngorm can be used to architect larger Flex applications, including tips to use Cairngorm in a less verbose way with HTTPService to talk to Rails.    Flexible Rails is for both Rails developers who are interested in Flex, and Flex developers who are interested in Rails. For a Rails developer, Flex allows for more dynamic and engaging user interfaces than are possible with Ajax. For a Flex developer, Rails provides a way to rapidly build the ORM and services layer of the application.","Quantity":9,"QuantitySold":62,"Cost":77,"Price":225,"Benefit":148,"BenefitSold":9176},{"Title":"Hello!

A project may involve dozens of developers, managers, architects, testers, and customers, hundreds of builds, and thousands of opportunities to get off-track. To keep tabs on the people, tasks, and components of a medium- to large-scale project, most teams use a development system that allows for easy monitoring, follow-up, and accountability.    Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2008 (TFS), the server component of Microsoft\u0027s Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), provides a powerful collaborative platform for software-development teams. The product offers an integrated toolset for tracking work items, creating test cases, managing source code, generating builds, constructing database schemas, and so on. Because in software development one size does not fit all, TFS provides process customization, project management, and reporting capabilities to build solutions around your requirements.    Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a hands-on guide to Team Foundation Server 2008. Written for developers with a good handle on TFS basics, this book shows you how to solve real-life problems.

So-called \u0022greenfield\u0022 projects often involve learning new technology and the opportunity for experimentation. Working on established software projects may seem less glamorous.    Most software developers have inherited a monolithic application where the day-to-day tasks involve maintenance, incremental improvements, or even cleaning up the mess another programmer left behind. These legacy or brownfield projects often have tightly coupled components, low cohesion, and poor separation of concerns, making them fragile and resistant to change.    Brownfield Application Development in .Net shows you how to approach legacy applications with the state-of-the-art concepts, patterns, and tools you\u0027ve learned to apply to new projects. Using an existing application as an example, this book guides you in applying the techniques and best practices you need to make it more maintainable and receptive to change.    Starting with the build process and the introduction of unit tests, the Authors show you how to set up the application so that in later chapters, you can make incremental changes aimed at decoupling components from each other. Each practice introduced will increase your confidence and ability to make subsequent changes to your code.

Why is this open-source tool so popular  Because it automates a tedious task: persisting your Java objects to a relational database. The inevitable mismatch between your object-oriented code and the relational database requires you to write code that maps one to the other. This code is often complex, tedious and costly to develop. Hibernate does the mapping for you.    Not only that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. And they perform better than anything you are likely to develop yourself.    Hibernate in Action carefully explains the concepts you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching.

It can mean parsing or filtering data, or the many steps required for data recognition. Or it can be something as simple as converting hours worked plus pay rates into a salary cheque.    This book shows you how to process data productively with Perl. It discusses general munging techniques and how to think about data munging problems. You will learn how to decouple the various stages of munging programs, how to design data structures, how to emulate the Unix filter model, etc. If you need to work with complex data formats it will teach you how to do that and also how to build your own tools to process these formats. The book includes detailed techniques for processing HTML and XML. And, it shows you how to build your own parsers to process data of arbitrary complexity.    If you are a programmer who munges data, this book will save you time. It will teach you systematic and powerful techniques using Perl.

Shobana Jayaraman, Digital Infrastructure Analyst, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Library, The Tech Static","LongDescription":"Seam is an exciting new application framework based on the Java EE platform that you can use to build rich, web-based business applications. Seam is rapidly capturing the interest of Java enterprise developers because of its focus on simplicity, ease of use, transparent integration, scalability, and developer choice.    Seam in Action offers a practical and in-depth look at Seam from outside the walls of RedHat/JBoss. The book puts Seam head-to-head with the complexities in the Java EE architecture. It discusses the shortcomings of JSF, the challenges of using Java persistence in the web environment, and other common development roadblocks, then shows how Seam makes these problems just melt away. In covering Seam, the author doesn\u0027t just ask you to sprinkle annotations on your code and expect that you understand how it works. Instead, the author lays down the facts, shows you the steps, reveals the logic, and diagrams the flow, so that by the end of the book, you will not only have gained a deep understanding of Seam, but will also come away ready to teach the material to others.    All too often, developers spend a majority of their time integrating disparate technologies, manually tracking state, struggling to understand JSF, wrestling with Hibernate exceptions, and constantly redeploying applications, rather than on the logic pertaining to the business at hand. Seam in Action dives deep into thorough explanations of how Seam eliminates these non-core tasks by leveraging configuration by exception, Java 5 annotations, and aspect-oriented programming.    To start off, you will see a working Java EE-compliant application come together by the end of the second chapter. As you progress through the book, you will discover how Seam eliminates unnecessary layers and configurations and uses an inversion of control technical known as bijection supplemented by a liberal use of the Unified Expression Language (EL) to establish the missing link between JSF, EJB 3 and JavaBean components. You also witness how Seam opens doors for you to incorporate technologies you previously have not had time to learn, such as business processes and stateful page flows (jBPM), rule-based security, Ajax remoting, PDF generation, Spring integration, and more.","Quantity":0,"QuantitySold":32,"Cost":74,"Price":368,"Benefit":294,"BenefitSold":9408},{"Title":"Wicket in Action","Isbn":"1932394982","PageCount":392,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/dashorst.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["Martijn Dashorst","Eelco Hillenius"],"Categories":["Web Development"],"ShortDescription":"null","LongDescription":"Wicket bridges the mismatch between the web\u0027s stateless protocol and Java\u0027s OO model.

Python and Tkinter Programming is the answer. It is designed for readers who are familiar with Python and who need to develop applications with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).    Python and Tkinter Programming presents the elements of typical Python and Tkinter applications in a straight-forward fashion. Sample code illustrates each element. Complete applications that go far beyond the fill-the-form class of graphical user interfaces are presented; here you will find examples of complex controls, drawn interfaces and photorealistic panels. The code can readily be used as templates for new applications. Extensions to Python (such as ODBC) are examined as well. Complete source code for all examples, along with the latest releases of required software, will be available from Manning\u0027s web site.    Tkinter is fully documented. To date, this level of documentation has not been available to Tkinter programmers, who have been required to read the code or interpret Tcl/Tk man pages to fully understand component usage.    Python and Tkinter Programming will be useful in both Windows and Unix environments, and the example code is portable between the two environments.","Quantity":9,"QuantitySold":96,"Cost":60,"Price":135,"Benefit":75,"BenefitSold":7200},{"Title":"Microsoft.NET for Programmers","Isbn":"1930110197","PageCount":386,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/grimes.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["Fergal Grimes"],"Categories":["Microsoft .NET"],"ShortDescription":"null","LongDescription":"Written for intermediate and advanced programmers, this book builds on your existing knowledge to teach you exactly what you need to know to develop .NET applications.

But you may still be wondering exactly \u0022What is OSGi \u0022    Simply put, OSGi is a technology that allows you to create highly modular Java applications. It introduces a logical and physical module format, called a bundle, for explicitly structuring your application as a set of interconnected modules. OSGi lets you install, start, stop, update, or uninstall modules at execution time without taking down your entire system. In addition, OSGi defines a local service-oriented approach for creating applications out of loosely coupled components.    With the prevalence of modern component and service-based architectures, OSGi is becoming increasingly important. It meshes well with such approaches and greatly simplifies their creation and management. It\u0027s the backbone of Eclipse\u0027s plugin system as well as many recent JavaEE containers, such as GlassFish v3, WebSphere v6.1, and WebLogic Event Server. Even the SpringSource Application Platform is built on top of it.    OSGi in Action is a comprehensive guide to OSGi with two primary goals.

GWT in Action is a comprehensive tutorial for Java developers interested in building the next generation of rich, web-based applications. This book was written by Robert Hanson, creator of the popular GWT Widget Library, and Adam Tacy, a major contributor to the GWT Widget Library.    The Web is experiencing a new growth with an emphasis on rich, web-based applications. These applications can be difficult to build because they rely on JavaScript, which lacks the sophisticated object-oriented structures and static typing of Java, they are tricky to debug, and they require you to manage numerous browser inconsistencies.    In May of 2006 Google released the Google Web Toolkit. GWT enables developers to create Ajax applications in Java. With GWT, you can build your applications using a real object-oriented language and take advantage of Java tools like Eclipse that are already available. Instead of trying to bring tool support to Ajax, Google brought Ajax to a place where the tools already existed.    GWT in Action shows you how to take advantage of these exciting new tools. This clearly-written book is packed with hands-on GWT examples. You   ll absorb the GWT philosophy as you build your first working GWT application.    The book begins by exploring the main features of GWT, including    Compiling Java to JavaScript, the magic that really defines GWT  Building client-side components  Convenient JUnit integration and testing  Interacting with JavaScript and existing JavaScript libraries  Internationalization  You   ll also see how GWT compares to other toolkits.    GWT in Action shows you how to set up your development environment, use and create widgets, communicate with the server, and much more. Readers will follow an example running throughout the book and quickly master the basics of GWT: widgets, panels, and event handling. The book covers the full development cycle, from setting up your development environment, to building the application, then deploying it to the web server. The entire core GWT library is discussed, with details and examples on how it can be extended.    You   ll cover:    Testing, debugging, and deploying GWT Applications  Communicating with GWT-RPC  Examining client-side RPC architecture  Alternative RPC tools: HTTPRequest, RequestBuilder, and FormPanel  Achieving interoperability in GWT with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  Making your GWT application flexible and supportable  GWT helps you make the most of Ajax in your web applications and GWT in Action helps you get more out of GWT.","Quantity":5,"QuantitySold":13,"Cost":74,"Price":293,"Benefit":219,"BenefitSold":2847},{"Title":"The Quick Python Book","Isbn":"1884777740","PageCount":444,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/harms.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["Daryl Harms","Kenneth McDonald"],"Categories":["Python"],"ShortDescription":"null","LongDescription":"The Quick Python Book is a clear, concise introduction to Python, one of the most elegant programming languages in existence.

With an easily scalable, pay-as-you-go model and very small startup costs, the cloud can be a great alternative to systems hosted in-house. Developers are scrambling to understand the impact a cloud-based approach will have on current and future projects.    Azure is Microsoft\u0027s full-fledged entry into the \u0022Cloud Services Platform\u0022 arena. Unlike other cloud offerings that address only one piece of the puzzle, Azure includes an operating system, a set of developer services, and a data model that can be used individually or together. It\u0027s designed to interact seamlessly with other .NET-based components, and leverages your knowledge of Visual Studio, the .NET platform, and SQL Server. It\u0027s also fully compatible with multiple internet protocols, including HTTP, REST, SOAP, and XML.

Gnuplot is the most widely used program to plot and visualize data for Unix/Linux systems and it is also popular for Windows and the Mac. It\u0027s open-source (as in free!), actively maintained, stable, and mature. It can deal with arbitrarily large data sets and is capable of producing high-quality, publication-ready graphics.    So far, the only comprehensive documentation available about gnuplot is the online reference documentation, which makes it both hard to get started and almost impossible to get a complete overview over all of its features. If you\u0027ve never tried gnuplot   or have found it tough to get your arms around   read on.    Gnuplot in Action is the first comprehensive introduction to gnuplot   from the basics to the power features and beyond. Besides providing a tutorial on gnuplot itself, it demonstrates how to apply and use gnuplot to extract intelligence from data. Particular attention is paid to tricky or poorly-explained areas. You will learn how to apply gnuplot to actual data analysis problems. This book looks at different types of graphs that can be generated with gnuplot and will discuss when and how to use them to extract actual information from data.    One of gnuplot\u0027s main advantages is that it requires no programming skills nor knowledge of advanced mathematical or statistical concepts. Gnuplot in Action assumes you have no previous knowledge of either gnuplot or statistics and data analysis. The books starts out with basic gnuplot concepts, then describes in depth how to get a graph ready for final presentation and to make it look \u0022just right\u0022 by including arrows, labels, and other decorations.    Next the book looks at advanced concepts, such as multi-dimensional graphs and false-color plots   powerful features for special purposes. The author also describes advanced applications of gnuplot, such as how to script gnuplot so that it can run unattended as a batch job, and how to call gnuplot from within a CGI script to generate graphics for dynamic websites on demand.    Gnuplot in Action makes gnuplot easy for anyone who needs to do data analysis, but doesn\u0027t have an education in analytical tools and methods.

There are    thousands    of them   so many that it can be nearly impossible to keep track of all the locations and settings you need to administer Windows effectively. For administrators, PowerShell is a godsend because it provides a single, unified command line from which you can control and automate every aspect of Windows. PowerShell finally enables Windows administrators to work in a way that Unix and Linux administrators have leveraged for decades.    Like classic administrative shells, PowerShell accepts and immediately executes typed commands. In addition, it has all the features of a full-fledged programming language built in, so you can create scripts to automate even the most complex tasks. And it\u0027s fully aware of all the components of Windows and most Windows servers, so you can use PowerShell to control Exchange, IIS, SharePoint, and other core pieces of your Windows system.    Learn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches is an innovative tutorial designed for busy administrators.

It provides a bottom-up understanding of security techniques appropriate for use in SOA without assuming any prior familiarity with security topics.    Unlike most other books about SOA that merely describe the standards, this book helps readers learn through action, by walking them through sample code that illustrates how real life problems can be solved using the techniques and best practices described in the standards. It simplifies things: where standards usually discuss many possible variations of each security technique, this book focuses on the 20% of variations that are used 80% of the time.

As a developer, you\u0027ll benefit from several big advantages to this change:  Rails becomes more modular, by building on rails core with the ability to opt in or out of specific components and making it possible to replace parts of Rails without disturbing other parts.  Merb performance improvements flow into Rails, including benchmarking applications so developers can see which optimizations have real-world impact.  A defined public API with a test suite, so users and plugin developers have a stable API to build against.  A \u0022core\u0022 version of Rails, like Merb\u0027s current core generator, that makes it easy to select just the parts that are important for your app.  DataMapper and Sequel support as first-class ORMs, along with ActiveRecord as the default.  Rack support in Rails 3, to improve the state of modular, sharable logic between applications.  The Rails 3 team is moving full steam ahead building the new version. The Merb team will start working on Rails immediately, and also continue to fix bugs and resolve other major issues in the current release of Merb. Interim versions of Merb will help ease the transition to Rails 3. In particular, Merb releases with deprecation notices and other transitional mechanisms will assist developers in tracking down the changes between Merb 1.x and Rails 3.

What happened  Will it regain its power and again drive economic growth as in the past     No.    That\u0027s the surprising conclusion reached by Erik Keller, a central player in the booming IT world of the 1990s. Driven by fear of being left behind, American corporations let IT grow until it reached one half of all corporate capital spending by the year 2000. Now, chastened by their spending failures, IT managers are converging on a new consensus: to exploit IT competitively they must use their smarts over big money.    This shift in thinking comes just as free, open-source software, low-cost international programming labor, and new technologies combine to make the new approach possible.    A former Research Fellow at Gartner, Keller had an insider\u0027s view of the irrational spending at many Fortune 500 companies, personally influencing billions of dollars of technology acquisitions.    In Technology Paradise Lost Keller describes how the new thinking is working inside some of the country\u0027s most complex and successful organizations, including Merrill Lynch, JetBlue, Harrah\u0027s, and Motorola which have cut IT spending to gain a competitive edge, and experienced marked gains to their bottom lines.    As it advances, the new IT think will cause further massive disruptions in the computer business, with fundamental changes in the ways software is developed, sold, and used. Efficiency of IT investment will grow as excess fat is squeezed out of IT salaries, software system costs, and consultants\u0027 fees.    In an unexpected twist, Keller argues that even as IT spending is reduced its importance for competitiveness will grow. Reduced spending does not mean IT has become a commodity. Counterintuitively, companies that spend less in order to get more from information technology will likely be the big winners.","Quantity":8,"QuantitySold":22,"Cost":28,"Price":441,"Benefit":413,"BenefitSold":9086},{"Title":"Kermit 95\u002B","Isbn":"1930110057","PageCount":0,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/kermit.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["Kermit Project at Columbia University"],"Categories":["Internet","Networking","Miscella"],"ShortDescription":"null","LongDescription":"Kermit 95\u002B, Version 2.1 is a full-featured, fully native, 32-bit communications software package for Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP and IBM OS/2 3.0 and later from the Kermit Project at Columbia University.

OpenLaszlo is an increasingly popular open-source platform for the development and delivery of rich internet applications across multiple platforms: Flash, DHTML, and J2ME. The dramatic emergence of Ajax over the past year was a first step in the transition from page-oriented HTML web applications towards more full-featured rich internet applications. OpenLaszlo provides another important step in this continuing evolutionary process through the increased productivity resulting from LZX\u0027s declarative approach. It provides developers with the tools to create web-based applications offering the usability and interactivity associated with desktop applications, and the low costs associated with web-based deployment. The cross-platform nature of Laszlo LZX applications allows source code with only minimum modifications to run natively on all popular web browsers, on all desktop operating systems, on the Flash platform, and other platforms in the future.    Written to address the needs of a wide spectrum of developers, ranging from client-side HTML and JavaScript developers all the way to enterprise-class Java or Rails engineers, this book provides a very hands-on approach towards building applications that solve real-world problems across both the Flash and DHTML platforms. Starting with the fundamentals of Laszlo LZX, the Authors quickly move towards applying this knowledge to the design and development of a full-scale application called the Laszlo Market. This provides a working context to assist understanding the underlying concepts of Laszlo LZX and, more importantly, how to apply this knowledge in innovative ways. The construction of the Laszlo Market proceeds over the course of the book illustrating topics starting with an initial wireframe and storyboard design to optimization issues dealing with the application\u0027s deployment across the Flash and DHTML platforms.","Quantity":1,"QuantitySold":57,"Cost":70,"Price":276,"Benefit":206,"BenefitSold":11742},{"Title":"Groovy in Action","Isbn":"1932394842","PageCount":696,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/koenig.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["Dierk Koenig with Andrew Glover","Paul King","Guillaume Laforge","Jon Skeet"],"Categories":["Java"],"ShortDescription":"null","LongDescription":"Groovy, the brand-new language for the Java platform, brings to Java many of the features that have made Ruby popular.

As NHibernate is a port of Hibernate from Java to .NET, the book is based on Manning\u0027s bestselling Hibernate in Action.    NHibernate in Action begins by describing how to implement persistence in a layered .NET application. The book then quickly springs into action by introducing NHibernate through a classic \u0022Hello World\u0022 example. It explains how to configure NHibernate to specify the mapping information between business objects and database tables, and then explores the internal architecture of NHibernate. A complete example application is progressively built with Agile methodologies in mind, which shows readers all kinds of entity and relationship mappings and how to perform CRUD operations. The book also covers advanced techniques like caching, concurrency access, and isolation levels. The Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and criteria query APIs are thoroughly detailed with optimization tips.    The last chapters of this book discuss various development scenarios, how to implement the layers of an NHibernate application (covering Windows and Web development), and which tools are available for these tasks. They also provide some solutions for data-binding objects to .NET GUI controls, integrating services, and interacting with components using DataSets. Finally, they explain how to build a complex application involving advanced session management and distributed transactions.","Quantity":9,"QuantitySold":35,"Cost":40,"Price":130,"Benefit":90,"BenefitSold":3150},{"Title":"Microsoft Reporting Services in Action","Isbn":"1932394222","PageCount":656,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/lachev.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["Teo Lachev"],"Categories":["Microsoft .NET"],"ShortDescription":"null","LongDescription":"Business reporting is a lifeline of business, so a better reporting environment is a big deal.

One of the central premises of object-oriented programming is that each concern should be implemented as a separate module.

Consequently, the code to handle these system-wide concerns may be mixed in with the core logic of a huge number of modules, resulting in lower productivity, poor quality, and systems that are hard to evolve.    Aspect-oriented programming overcomes these problems by modularizing the system-wide concerns.    AspectJ enables AOP programming in Java by adding a few new language constructs. By using Java as the base language and creating a final system that is compatible with Java byte code specification, AspectJ passes on all the benefits of Java.

This definition naturally leads to an obvious question, \u0022What are \u0022maps\u0022 and why do they need to be \u0022reduced \u0022    Massive data sets can be extremely difficult to analyze and query using traditional mechanisms, especially when the queries themselves are quite complicated. In effect, the MapReduce algorithm breaks up both the query and the data set into constituent parts   that\u0027s the \u0022mapping.\u0022 The mapped components of the query can be processed simultaneously   or \u0022reduced\u0022   to rapidly return results.

The intended readers are programmers, architects, and project managers who have to process large amounts of data offline. Hadoop in Action will lead the reader from obtaining a copy of Hadoop to setting it up in a cluster and writing data analytic programs.    The book begins by making the basic idea of Hadoop and MapReduce easier to grasp by applying the default Hadoop installation to a few easy-to-follow tasks, such as analyzing changes in word frequency across a body of documents. The book continues through the basic concepts of MapReduce applications developed using Hadoop, including a close look at framework components, use of Hadoop for a variety of data analysis tasks, and numerous examples of Hadoop in action.    Hadoop in Action will explain how to use Hadoop and present design patterns and practices of programming MapReduce. MapReduce is a complex idea both conceptually and in its implementation, and Hadoop users are challenged to learn all the knobs and levers for running Hadoop. This book takes you beyond the mechanics of running Hadoop, teaching you to write meaningful programs in a MapReduce framework.    This book assumes the reader will have a basic familiarity with Java, as most code examples will be written in Java. Familiarity with basic statistical concepts (e.g. histogram, correlation) will help the reader appreciate the more advanced data processing examples.","Quantity":5,"QuantitySold":7,"Cost":19,"Price":334,"Benefit":315,"BenefitSold":2205},{"Title":"SQR in PeopleSoft and Other Applications","Isbn":"1884777775","PageCount":600,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/landres.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["Galina","Vlad Landres"],"Categories":["Business","Client-Server"],"ShortDescription":"null","LongDescription":"A software system is the realization of a set of concerns.

ASP.NET MVC is a development framework designed around these principles. It provides the structure you need to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, in which an application is divided into three distinct parts:        * Models, the objects that contain an application\u0027s logic      * Views, the components that create the user interface of an application      * Controllers, the components that handle and respond to user input    Applications built with ASP.NET MVC are easier to test, maintain, and extend because the architecture and role of each component is well-defined. And since it\u0027s built from the ground up as a core part of the .NET framework, it integrates seamlessly with the ASP.NET features, such as Web Forms or Master Pages, that you already use.

OOram has been fine-tuned over a decade on hundreds of projects by Trygve Reenskaug and his collaborators. It is supported by available CASE tools, training, and consulting.    Working With Objects is the source on a method which takes an evolutionary step forward in object-oriented development practices. OOram adds the intuitively simple but powerful concept of a role to object-oriented models and methods. For example, imagine trying to describe a person as an object. The most effective way to do this would be to independently describe each of the roles that person adopts (parent, employee, and so on) and then define how the person supports them. These ideas form the heart of the OOram approach.    In a presentation rich with examples, Working With Objects is anything but the typical, dry methodology book. It tells real-life stories.

Unfortunately, it\u0027s not so easy to bring Agile into an existing organization with established people and practices. Becoming Agile shows you practical techniques and strategies to move from your existing process to an Agile process without starting from scratch.    Many books discuss Agile from a theoretical or academic perspective. Becoming Agile takes a different approach and focuses on explaining Agile from a ground-level point-of-view. Author Greg Smith, a certified ScrumMaster with dozens of Agile projects under his belt, presents Agile principles in the context of a case study that flows throughout the book.    Becoming Agile focuses on the importance of adapting Agile principles to the realities of your environment. While Agile purists have often discouraged a    partial-Agile    approach, the reality is that in many shops a    purist    approach simply isn\u0027t a viable option. Over the last few years, Agile authorities have begun to discover that the best deployments of Agile are often customized to the specific situation of a given company.  As well, Becoming Agile addresses the cultural realities of deploying Agile and how to deal with the needs of executives, managers, and the development team during migration. The author discusses employee motivation and establishing incentives that reward support of Agile techniques.    Becoming Agile will show you how to create a custom Agile process that supports the realities of your environment. The process will minimize risk as you transition to Agile iteratively, allowing time for your culture and processes to acclimate to Agile principles.","Quantity":5,"QuantitySold":61,"Cost":85,"Price":191,"Benefit":106,"BenefitSold":6466},{"Title":"ActiveMQ in Action","Isbn":"1933988940","PageCount":408,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/snyder.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["Bruce Snyder","Dejan Bosanac","","Rob Davies"],"Categories":["Java"],"ShortDescription":"ActiveMQ is implemented in Java, but it supports client applications written in many other programming languages including C/C\u002B\u002B, .NET, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Python, and more.

You can put the book to immediate use even if you don\u0027t have deep knowledge of every part of Spring Framework.","LongDescription":"For enterprise Java developers, Spring Framework provides remarkable improvements in developer productivity, runtime performance, and overall application quality. Its unique blend of a complete, lightweight container that allows you to build a complex application from loosely-coupled POJOs and a set of easily understood abstractions that simplify construction, testing, and deployment make Spring both powerful and easy-to-use   a hard-to-beat combination. With this power comes the potential for a wide range of uses in both common and not-so-common scenarios. That\u0027s where Spring in Practice comes in.    Unlike the many books that teach you what Spring is, Spring in Practice shows you how to tackle the challenges you face when you build Spring-based applications. The book empowers software developers to solve concrete business problems \u0022the Spring way\u0022 by mapping application-level issues to Spring-centric solutions.    Spring in Practice diverges from other cookbooks because it presents the background you need to understand the domain in which a solution applies before it offers the specific steps to solve the problem. You\u0027re never left with the feeling that you understand the answer, but find the question irrelevant. You can put the book to immediate use even if you don\u0027t have deep knowledge of every part of Spring Framework.    The book divides into three main parts. In Part 1, you\u0027ll get a rapid overview of Spring Framework   enough to get you started if you\u0027re new and a great refresher for readers who already have a few Spring cycles. Part 2 provides techniques that are likely to be useful no matter what type of application you\u0027re building. You\u0027ll find discussions of topics like user accounts, security, site navigation, and application diagnosis.    Part 3 provides domain-specific recipes. Here, you\u0027ll find practical solutions to realistic and interesting business problems. For example, this part discusses Spring-based approaches for ecommerce, lead generation, and CRM.    There are several recurring themes throughout Spring in Practice, including Spring MVC, Hibernate, and transactions. Each recipe is an opportunity to highlight something new or interesting about Spring, and to focus on that concept in detail.    This book assumes you have a good foundation in Java and Java EE. Prior exposure to Spring Framework is helpful, but not required.","Quantity":9,"QuantitySold":66,"Cost":78,"Price":385,"Benefit":307,"BenefitSold":20262},{"Title":"Java 2 Micro Edition","Isbn":"1930110332","PageCount":504,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/white.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["James P.

Which browsers support what features? When the specification will be complete? HTML5, along with supporting technologies like CSS3, SVG, and JavaScript, gives web developers powerful new features like local storage, better audio and video support, and standards-driven mobile application development. And it\u0027s ready to use now, with browser support from Microsoft, Google, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera.\n\nHTML5 In Action provides a complete introduction to web development using HTML5. You\u0027ll explore every aspect of the HTML5 specification through real-world examples and code samples. It\u0027s much more than just a specification reference, though. It lives up to the name HTML5 in Action by giving you the practical, hands-on guidance you\u0027ll need to use key features like:\n\n    * The new semantic elements and form input types\n    * Native multimedia playback with the video and audio elements\n    * Canvas and 2D drawing APIs\n    * Offline applications\n    * Local and session storage, IndexedDB databases\n    * Web workers\n    * Geolocation, File API, History API\n    * Cross-document Message API\n    * Much, much more\n\nWith this book, you can confidently start using HTML5 today. The relevant, easy-to-follow examples will make you a HTML5 master in no time. You\u0027ll even learn how to provide fallbacks for browsers that don\u0027t support particular HTML5 features.","Quantity":8,"QuantitySold":43,"Cost":66,"Price":367,"Benefit":301,"BenefitSold":12943},{"Title":"Java Persistence with Hibernate, Second Edition","Isbn":"1617290459","PageCount":0,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/bauer3.jpg","Status":"MEAP","Authors":["Christian Bauer","Gavin King","","Gary Gregory"],"Categories":[],"ShortDescription":"null","LongDescription":"null","Quantity":6,"QuantitySold":88,"Cost":50,"Price":441,"Benefit":391,"BenefitSold":34408},{"Title":"Hadoop in Practice","Isbn":"1617290238","PageCount":0,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/holmes.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["Alex Holmes"],"Categories":[],"ShortDescription":"null","LongDescription":"null","Quantity":9,"QuantitySold":32,"Cost":88,"Price":247,"Benefit":159,"BenefitSold":5088},{"Title":"HBase in Action","Isbn":"1617290521","PageCount":0,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/dimidukkhurana.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["Nicholas Dimiduk","Amandeep Khurana"],"Categories":[],"ShortDescription":"null","LongDescription":"null","Quantity":10,"QuantitySold":23,"Cost":25,"Price":195,"Benefit":170,"BenefitSold":3910},{"Title":"Flex Mobile in Action","Isbn":"1617290610","PageCount":0,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/campos.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["Jonathan Campos"],"Categories":[],"ShortDescription":"null","LongDescription":"null","Quantity":1,"QuantitySold":55,"Cost":88,"Price":292,"Benefit":204,"BenefitSold":11220},{"Title":"HTML5 for .NET Developers","Isbn":"1617290432","PageCount":0,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/jackson.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["Jim Jackson","II","Ian Gilman"],"Categories":[],"ShortDescription":"null","LongDescription":"null","Quantity":2,"QuantitySold":24,"Cost":51,"Price":208,"Benefit":157,"BenefitSold":3768},{"Title":"50 Android Hacks","Isbn":"1617290564","PageCount":0,"PublishedDate":{"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"ThumbnailUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/sessa.jpg","Status":"PUBLISH","Authors":["Carlos M.
